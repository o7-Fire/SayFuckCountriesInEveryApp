# Extra Info

- make sure it runs on your machine, we don't care about other machine
- don't commit library, cache, or anything else that is not important e.g. `node_module`, `output`, `build`, `cache`
- file path **IS AND SHOULD BE** case-sensitive
- for impossible implementation (or you're lazy),
 create `platform/language/IMPOSSIBLE.txt` with
 reason in it ~that we won't be reading~

# Media

- `Twitter` - Twitter Post Tweet about Fuck {Country}
- `Github` - markdown file content
- `Kahoot` - Fill server with bots named Fuck {Country}
